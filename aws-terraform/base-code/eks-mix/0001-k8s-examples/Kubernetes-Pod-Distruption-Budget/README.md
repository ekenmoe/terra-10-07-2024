## Pod Disruption Budget
[Pod Disruption Budget in kubernetes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqDDwPpe2Po)

**Pod Disruption Budget**  ==>> a budget of voluntary disruption
We use it to make sure that the application is not impacted by any Voluntary Disrution.

An Application Owner can create a PodDisruptionBudget object (PDB) for each application. A PDB limits the number pods of a replicated application that are down simultaneously from voluntary disruptions. For example, a quorum-based application would like to ensure that the number of replicas running is never brought below the number needed for a quorum. A web front end might want to ensure that the number of replicas serving load never falls below a certain percentage of the total.

## Pod Disruption Budget Type
### Voluntary Disrution (perform by admin/owner)
- Draining a node (repair/maintennce/upgrade)
- Remove pods from the node to do something
- Delete an object accindentally (pod, deploy, sts, ds)
- Node package upgrade

## Where can we use Pod Disruption Budget in K8S?
- In deployment
- ReplicationController
- Replicaset
- StatefulSet

### Inoluntary Disrution (unavoidable)
- A hadware failure
- Amin deletes VM by mistake
- Cloud provider/hhypervisor failre
- Node beig out of resourced

### minAvailable
2 pods should alow be available
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  minAvailable: 2 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
```

### minAvailable
- all pods should always be available
- we cannot even upgrade the cluster because eviction pod is not allow
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  minAvailable: 0
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx

apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  minAvailable: 100%
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
```

### minAvailable
2 pods should alow be always available
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  minAvailable: 2 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
```

70% of pods should alow be always available
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  minAvailable: 75% 
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
```

### maxUnAvailable
Only 2 pod should alow to be unavailable
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: pdbdemo
spec:
  maxUnAvailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: nginx
```

### Drain command with pdb set 
```
kubectl drain [node name] \
    --delete-emptydir-adta \
    --ingnore-daemonsets
```
